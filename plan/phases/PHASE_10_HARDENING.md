# Phase 10: Hardening and production readiness

## Goal
Make oni robust on mainnet under real-world adversarial conditions.

## Deliverables
- Extensive fuzzing and corpus management
- Adversarial network simulation
- Soak testing and memory stability
- Performance tuning and regression gates
- Release pipeline and artifacts (SBOM, containers)

## Work packages
- Nightly fuzz campaigns
- Differential test expansion
- Soak test harness
- Performance tuning (crypto, DB, caching)
- Release automation and upgrade docs

## Acceptance criteria
- Multi-day soak run with stable memory.
- Bench regressions caught before release.
- Reproducible release artifacts.
