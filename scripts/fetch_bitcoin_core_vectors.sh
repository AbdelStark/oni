# The project will eventually vendor or sync canonical test vectors from Bitcoin Core
# (and/or the BIPs repo) in a license-compatible way.
#
# Recommended approach:
# - add Bitcoin Core as a git submodule under `vendor/bitcoin`
# - extract required test data into `test_vectors/` with provenance metadata
#
# TODO: implement when the consensus test harness is in place.
