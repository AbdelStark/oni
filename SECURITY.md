# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open public issues for security reports.

Instead, email the maintainers at:

- security@oni.example (placeholder)

Include:
- a clear description of the vulnerability
- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment
- any suggested fix or mitigation

## Supported versions

Until the first stable release, security fixes will target `main`.

After a stable release:
- latest stable release will receive security fixes
- older versions may receive fixes depending on severity

## Coordinated disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure:
- acknowledge receipt
- reproduce and assess severity
- develop a fix and release
- publish an advisory (when appropriate)

For the technical threat model and security design, see `docs/SECURITY.md`.
