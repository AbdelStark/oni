# Code of Conduct

oni is an open and inclusive project. We expect everyone participating to:

- Be respectful and professional.
- Assume good intent; ask questions before judging.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks.
- Focus discussions on technical merits and project goals.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates these expectations, report it privately to the maintainers (see `SECURITY.md` for contact structure, or open a private channel as documented).

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action necessary to keep the community safe and productive, including warnings and removal from participation.
