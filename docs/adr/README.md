# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use ADRs to document significant decisions (DB engine choice, crypto approach, RPC compatibility level, etc).

## Template

Create a new file `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`:

- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Alternatives considered
- References

Keep ADRs short and factual.
